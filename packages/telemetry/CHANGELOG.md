# @n8io/baseline-telemetry

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- daecd9a: The @n8io/baseline-* packages publish publicly to npmjs, so installs need no npm token. Projects drop the `@n8io:registry` line from `.npmrc`, and the image builds with no `packages_token` secret.
- b73602b: Telemetry now builds the metric reader itself, like the span and log processors: `OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER` (`otlp` by default, `console` or `none`) and `OTEL_METRIC_EXPORT_INTERVAL` choose a periodic reader. Every signal exports OTLP over http/protobuf only; the grpc and http/json exporters are gone, and an `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_*PROTOCOL` set to anything else prints one warning at start. The app's integration tests read OTLP protobuf and prove the use case duration metric reaches a collector.

### Patch Changes

- 6e5f6e7: baseline is open source under the MIT license, and every package declares `"license": "MIT"`. The template is fetched over plain HTTPS, so `domain-create` and `template-upgrade` no longer need a `gh` login; `app-create` needs one only to create the project repo.
- 793ad13: Each package ships a README on npmjs: what it does, how to install it, its exports, an example, and the env vars and peers it needs.
- 33c61e9: Loader and action spans are now named after the route that owns them (`loader root`, `loader routes/foo-list`) rather than the request's pattern, which gave every matched route's loader the same name. `http.route` and the server span name now start with a slash (`GET /foos`, `GET /` for the index), as the HTTP semantic conventions require.
