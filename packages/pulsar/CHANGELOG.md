# @n8io/baseline-pulsar

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- ef20aa0: Events go through one `Events` handle, whatever carries them, so moving Events from the queue to Pulsar changes one file in a Project instead of every Domain.

  `@n8io/baseline-queue` exports `Events` (`consumersSubscribe`, `consumersStart`, `publisherCreate(transaction)`, `isAlive`), `EventsPublisher` (`publish`, then `committed()` once the transaction has committed) and `queueEventsCreate(queue)`. `queueEventsPgBossCreate`, `QueueEvents`, `queueConsumersSubscribe` and `queueConsumersStart` are gone. `queueCreate`, `publisherCreate` and `queueInboxInsert` take a `QueueSql` (anything with `query(text, values?)`), so the package no longer has `pg` or `@types/pg` peers.

  `@n8io/baseline-pulsar` exports `pulsarCreate` (its `token` may now be `undefined`) and `pulsarEventsCreate(pulsar)`, which now returns that same `Events`. `PulsarEvents`, `pulsarConsumersSubscribe` and `pulsarConsumersStart` are gone; `send()` is `committed()`.

  In the Template, the new `src/events-open.ts` is the only file that names the transport, and `connectionsOpen` returns it as `connections.events`.

  When you upgrade:
  - In each Domain's `spi/<domain>-transaction.postgres.ts`, take `events: Events` in place of `queue: Queue`, create the publisher with `events.publisherCreate<<Domain>EventMap>(pgClient)`, and call `committed()` on it after `postgresTransactionRun` returns ok. Copy the shape from Foo.
  - In each Domain's `spi/index.ts`, read `connections.events` in place of `connections.queue`.
  - In `src/server.ts`, call `connections.events.consumersSubscribe([...])`. In `src/worker.ts`, call `events.consumersStart([...])` and report `queue.isAlive() && events.isAlive()`.
  - In tests that build a Postgres transaction, pass `queueEventsCreate(queue)`.
  - A Project already on Pulsar moves its client into `src/events-open.ts` as the pulsar README shows, and drops its other Pulsar wiring.

### Minor Changes

- 867f91e: Vendor-only settings have one way in. `postgresPoolCreate`, `postgresMigrate`, `queueCreate`, `queueMigrate`, `pulsarCreate` and `analyticsMixpanelCreate` take a `vendor` option, typed as the vendor's own settings and passed through: `ssl` for Postgres, pg-boss's tuning, OAuth2 or mTLS for Pulsar, Mixpanel's `host` for data residency. A Package's named options win, and `vendor` throws on the keys they set and on the ones that would do nothing. `vendor` is outside each Package's contract: it is not tested, and a vendor swap deletes it.

  In the Template, `docs/agents/vendor-settings.md` says when to use it, and architecture rule A12 allows the vendor factories only in `src/connections.ts`, `src/redis.ts` and the `src/*-open.ts` files.

  A factory that is one vendor's takes one options object: `analyticsMixpanelCreate({ token, vendor? })`, `cacheStoreRedisCreate({ redisClient })` and `liveHubRedisCreate({ redisClient })` replace their positional forms. When you upgrade, wrap the argument of those three calls.

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- a89218f: Count Events whose send fails after the commit on the `baseline.pulsar.events_lost` counter, with `messaging.destination.name` as its only attribute, so a lost Event can be alerted on.

### Patch Changes

  - @n8io/baseline-queue@4.0.0

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 5467b94: Factories that build and return a thing now end in `Create`: `cacheMemory` is `cacheMemoryCreate`, `cacheRedis` is `cacheRedisCreate`, `queueEventsMemory` is `queueEventsMemoryCreate`, `queueEventsPgBoss` is `queueEventsPgBossCreate` and `pulsarEvents` is `pulsarEventsCreate`. There are no deprecated aliases; rename the imports.

### Minor Changes

- daecd9a: The @n8io/baseline-* packages publish publicly to npmjs, so installs need no npm token. Projects drop the `@n8io:registry` line from `.npmrc`, and the image builds with no `packages_token` secret.

### Patch Changes

- 6e5f6e7: baseline is open source under the MIT license, and every package declares `"license": "MIT"`. The template is fetched over plain HTTPS, so `domain-create` and `template-upgrade` no longer need a `gh` login; `app-create` needs one only to create the project repo.
- 793ad13: Each package ships a README on npmjs: what it does, how to install it, its exports, an example, and the env vars and peers it needs.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- f9e3433: New package `@n8io/baseline-pulsar`: Events and Consumers on Apache Pulsar 5, sent after the transaction commits, with the queue package's inbox for duplicates. Schedules stay on pg-boss. The queue package now exports `queueJobRun` and `queueRetryLimit`, which the pulsar package shares. The glossary's Event is now delivered once the change that caused it commits.
