# @n8io/baseline-cache

## 6.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 1b14e24: Keep serving through a Redis outage.
  - cache: `cacheCreate` fails open. A store error or timeout is a miss on `get` and resolves on `set` and `delete`; it is counted on `baseline.cache.store_errors` and logged once per 30 s. After a failed `set` or `delete` the same process reads that id as a miss until the entry has expired. `onStoreError: "throw"` keeps the old behaviour. The package now has `@opentelemetry/api` as a peer.
  - live: `liveHub.send` never rejects. A lost update is counted on `baseline.live.sends_failed` and logged once per 30 s. When the Redis subscriber reconnects, every open stream sends `ready` again within 1 to 5 s, so pages reread what they missed. The package now has `@opentelemetry/api` as a peer.
  - app: no code to change in a Project. Tests show a Use case still answers with the cache store or the hub down, and `docs/agents/pieces.md` states how stale a cached read can be (the entry's lifetime, 60 s by default).

## 6.0.0

### Major Changes

- bcdb0ce: A function with three or more inputs takes one typed input object, and Biome's `useMaxParams` (max 2) now fails on a third parameter in the packages and the Template. A callback whose shape a library fixes (pino's `logMethod`, the Pulsar client's log, `String.replace`, the `DrizzleQueryError` constructor in a logger test) carries a `biome-ignore` naming that library.

  Breaking changes in the packages, with the new call:
  - `@n8io/baseline-cache`: `CacheStore.set({ json, key, ttlMs })`. A Project's own `CacheStore` changes its `set` the same way. `Cache<T>.set(id, value)` is unchanged.
  - `@n8io/baseline-live/client`: `useLiveUpdates({ channel, id, pathPrefix? })`.
  - `@n8io/baseline-postgres`: `postgresTransactionRun({ pgPool, timeoutMs?, work })`, where a `null` or missing `timeoutMs` means 5 s.
  - `@n8io/baseline-queue`: `queueConsumerCreate({ eventName, queueName, run, schema })`, `queueScheduleCreate({ cron, name, run })`, `queueSchedulesRegister({ env, queue, schedules })` and `queueJobRun({ job, queueName, work })`.

  `@n8io/baseline-authn` and `@n8io/baseline-pulsar` change only inside.

  In the Template, `useLiveUpdates`, `queueScheduleCreate`, `queueSchedulesRegister` and the test helpers move to the object form. A Use case that a Consumer calls takes the `inbox` in its input, `u.invoiceCreate(actor, { amountCents, customerId, inbox })`, so a Use case keeps two parameters. To upgrade a Project: change each call above, including every Domain's `api/<domain>-schedule.ts` (`queueScheduleCreate`), `src/worker.ts` (`queueSchedulesRegister`), each `ui/routes/<domain>-detail.tsx` (`useLiveUpdates`), each `spi/<domain>-transaction.postgres.ts` (`postgresTransactionRun`) and each Consumer and the Use case it calls. Each Domain's tests copied from foo change too: `spi/<domain>-transaction.postgres.test.ts` (`queueConsumerCreate`), `test/integration/<domain>-worker-shutdown.test.ts` (`productionServerWaitFor`), and the local helpers in `api/<domain>-routes.test.ts`, `ui/routes/<domain>-detail.test.ts` and `use-cases/<domain>-stale-archive.test.ts`; then run `pnpm check`, which names any function left with three parameters.

### Patch Changes

- 3695b6e: The Template's wiring functions each take one input object: `connectionsOpen({ role })`, `redisOpen({ steps, url })`, `redisClientCreate({ url })`, `cacheStoreOpen({ redis })`, `liveHubOpen({ redis, steps })`, `queueOpen({ database, intakes, resources, role })`, `analyticsOpen({ steps, token })` and `errorTrackingOpen({ dsn, environment, steps })`. `src/connections.ts` now reads `ENV` from `#env` itself (rule A22 allows it, and `src/events-open.ts`, where the Pulsar guide reads `PULSAR_URL`), so a call site passes only the role. `queueOpen` returns `{ events, queue }` and calls `eventsOpen` only once the queue is real, so `eventsOpen` takes a `Queue` and returns `Events`; the Pulsar guide shows the new shape.

  To upgrade, change every `connectionsOpen(ENV, "publisher")` to `connectionsOpen({ role: "publisher" })` (and `"worker"` likewise), and drop the `ENV` import where nothing else uses it. Each Domain's copied tests call it: `spi/index.test.ts`, `spi/index-queue.test.ts`, `api/<domain>-live.test.ts`, `ui/routes/<domain>-list.test.ts` and `ui/routes/<domain>-detail.test.ts`. Change any call of the other functions above in the Project's own code to the object form. A Project with its own `src/events-open.ts` changes its `queue` type to `Queue` and its return type to `Events`.

  `env-files.test.ts` checks `.env.development` and `.env.test` with `varlock load` itself instead of a hand-written parser of `.env.schema` decorators, so it now also checks each value's type. It reads only the committed files, never a `.local` one. Undeclared items and plain values in `.env.production` are still refused. The Template's piece markers are down from 87 to 82, and a root test keeps them at 91 or fewer, 6 per file (7 in `src/connections.ts`).

  The Template's CI now calls `app-ci.yml@v6`.

## 5.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 94f2893: Four Packages no longer need you to install Zod to use them. You bring the schema library, and each README shows how to pass a Zod schema.
  - `@n8io/baseline-cache` and `@n8io/baseline-queue`: `cacheCreate`'s `schema` and `queueConsumerCreate`'s schema are any [Standard Schema](https://standardschema.dev), so a Zod, Valibot or ArkType schema goes in as it is. Calls that pass a Zod schema do not change. The `zod` peer is gone. A Consumer's validation error now names the paths that failed in its message (`Event failed validation for billing.order-placed at totalCents`) and has no `cause`, so no validator's message can put an Event's values in a log.
  - `@n8io/baseline-id`: `idSchemaCreate` is gone. `idPatternCreate(prefix)` returns the `RegExp` to build an id schema from, in any schema library.
  - `@n8io/baseline-authn`: `Actor` is a type only; the Zod schema of the same name is no longer exported. Zod is the package's own dependency now, not a peer.

  `@n8io/baseline-http` keeps its `zod` peer: it is built on `@hono/zod-openapi`.

  In the Template, the new `src/id-schema.ts` exports `idSchemaCreate`, the Zod schema built from `idPatternCreate`. Foo: `models/foo.ts` imports `idSchemaCreate` from `../../../id-schema.ts`, not from `@n8io/baseline-id`, and `ui/routes/foo-detail.tsx` parses the id with `Foo.shape.id`. When you upgrade, change that import in every Domain's `models/<domain>.ts` and anywhere else that imports `idSchemaCreate`.

  This Release is `app@5.0.0`, so it creates the tag `v5`. The Template's `ci.yml` calls `app-ci.yml@v5` and `dependabot-automerge.yml@v5`; `v4` stays frozen at `app@4.0.0`.

## 5.0.0

### Major Changes

- 22c4a54: The cache's backend is picked once per process, not once per Domain. `@n8io/baseline-cache` now exports `CacheStore`, `cacheCreate(store, { prefix, schema, ttlMs? })`, `cacheStoreRedisCreate({ redisClient })` and `cacheStoreMemoryCreate()`. `cacheRedisCreate`, `cacheMemoryCreate`, `cacheRedisClientCreate` and the `RedisClient` type are gone, and the package no longer has a `redis` peer: the Redis store takes any connected node-redis client.

  In the Template, the new `src/cache-store-open.ts` is the only file that picks the backend, and `connectionsOpen` returns its store as `connections.cacheStore`. With `memory://` every cache shares one store, as on Redis, so two caches need different prefixes. Architecture rule A12 refuses `cacheStoreRedisCreate(` in a Domain. Each Domain has one `spi/<domain>-cache.ts` (`<domain>CacheCreate(cacheStore)`) with one `spi/<domain>-cache.test.ts`.

  When you upgrade, in each Domain: replace `spi/<domain>-cache.redis.ts` and `spi/<domain>-cache.memory.ts` with a `spi/<domain>-cache.ts` copied from Foo, replace their two tests and `spi/<domain>-cache.contract.ts` with Foo's `spi/foo-cache.test.ts`, pass `connections.cacheStore` in `spi/index.ts`, and pass `cacheStoreMemoryCreate()` in `spi/<domain>-ports.memory.ts`. If you used `cacheRedisClientCreate`, use `redisClientCreate` from the Template's `src/redis.ts`; outside the Template, call node-redis's `createClient` yourself with an `error` listener, a connect timeout and a reconnect strategy.
- 867f91e: Vendor-only settings have one way in. `postgresPoolCreate`, `postgresMigrate`, `queueCreate`, `queueMigrate`, `pulsarCreate` and `analyticsMixpanelCreate` take a `vendor` option, typed as the vendor's own settings and passed through: `ssl` for Postgres, pg-boss's tuning, OAuth2 or mTLS for Pulsar, Mixpanel's `host` for data residency. A Package's named options win, and `vendor` throws on the keys they set and on the ones that would do nothing. `vendor` is outside each Package's contract: it is not tested, and a vendor swap deletes it.

  In the Template, `docs/agents/vendor-settings.md` says when to use it, and architecture rule A12 allows the vendor factories only in `src/connections.ts`, `src/redis.ts` and the `src/*-open.ts` files.

  A factory that is one vendor's takes one options object: `analyticsMixpanelCreate({ token, vendor? })`, `cacheStoreRedisCreate({ redisClient })` and `liveHubRedisCreate({ redisClient })` replace their positional forms. When you upgrade, wrap the argument of those three calls.

## 4.0.0

### Major Changes

- dc8c9de: live no longer depends on `@n8io/baseline-cache`, so a project can install live without cache. `liveHubRedisCreate` takes any connected node-redis client, including the one `cacheRedisClientCreate` returns, and owns its own timeout. cache no longer exports `cacheTimeLimit`; copy the few lines into your code if you used it.

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- 5467b94: Factories that build and return a thing now end in `Create`: `cacheMemory` is `cacheMemoryCreate`, `cacheRedis` is `cacheRedisCreate`, `queueEventsMemory` is `queueEventsMemoryCreate`, `queueEventsPgBoss` is `queueEventsPgBossCreate` and `pulsarEvents` is `pulsarEventsCreate`. There are no deprecated aliases; rename the imports.

### Minor Changes

- daecd9a: The @n8io/baseline-* packages publish publicly to npmjs, so installs need no npm token. Projects drop the `@n8io:registry` line from `.npmrc`, and the image builds with no `packages_token` secret.

### Patch Changes

- 6e5f6e7: baseline is open source under the MIT license, and every package declares `"license": "MIT"`. The template is fetched over plain HTTPS, so `domain-create` and `template-upgrade` no longer need a `gh` login; `app-create` needs one only to create the project repo.
- 793ad13: Each package ships a README on npmjs: what it does, how to install it, its exports, an example, and the env vars and peers it needs.
- Updated dependencies [daecd9a]

  - @n8io/baseline-logger@2.1.0

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- b99f091: Trim exports nobody imports and the dependencies nobody uses.
  - logger: the root no longer exports `LoggerErr`, `loggerErrSerialize`, `loggerRedactPaths` or `LoggerFields`. Import `loggerErrSerialize` from `@n8io/baseline-logger/err-serialize`.
  - authn: the root no longer exports `AuthnInvalidError`.
  - live: the root no longer exports the `LiveUpdate` type. `liveRedis` now takes the `RedisClient` type and time limit from `@n8io/baseline-cache`.
  - cache: `cacheRedisClientCreate` takes only `{ cacheUrl }`, and the root exports `cacheTimeLimit`.
  - postgres: drops its unused `zod` peer dependency.
  - app: drops the unused `lucide-react` dependency.
