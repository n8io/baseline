Telemetry now builds the metric reader itself, like the span and log processors: `OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER` (`otlp` by default, `console` or `none`) and `OTEL_METRIC_EXPORT_INTERVAL` choose a periodic reader. Every signal exports OTLP over http/protobuf only; the grpc and http/json exporters are gone, and an `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_*PROTOCOL` set to anything else prints one warning at start. The app's integration tests read OTLP protobuf and prove the use case duration metric reaches a collector.
