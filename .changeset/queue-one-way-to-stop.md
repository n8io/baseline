`queueStop` is gone: call `queue.stop()`. `schedulesRegister` takes the composition root's `ENV` (any object; an item that is not a string is no override), so the Worker no longer reads `process.env`. The shutdown package no longer exports the `ShutdownOptions` type; server.ts and worker.ts use `ShutdownHandle`. The postgres and queue tests share one Postgres test setup in `test/postgres/`.
