`httpSecureHeaders` applies Hono's secure headers (HSTS, nosniff, Referrer-Policy and the rest) with an enforced Content-Security-Policy: `default-src 'self'`, `script-src 'self'` plus a per-request nonce, `object-src 'none'`, `base-uri 'self'` and `frame-ancestors 'none'`. The app uses it on every response and hands the nonce to React Router's server render, so every inline script carries it, in development too. Request bodies on `/api/*` are capped at 1 MB and a bigger one answers 413 `PayloadTooLarge`. The memory issuer's sign-in pages drop their inline styles, which the CSP blocks. Rate limiting stays at the load balancer or edge.
